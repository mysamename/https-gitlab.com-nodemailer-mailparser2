Receivers rely on RBLs to help prevent unwanted mail from getting through
to recipients. There is (or should be) some understanding that utilizing an
RBL will result in bad mail being blocked, and good mail not being blocked.
In this respect, SORBS is pretty good. Plenty of false positives (by that I
mean good senders getting listed, not erroneous listings), but the reason
for listing is almost always very predictable. Not to mention, as Michelle
said, even by default there is enough info from SORBS to find the source of
the problem.

On another note...Saying "RBLs don't block mail" is a fun thing to say to
win an argument, but it is a lot like interrupting someone to say, "You
know technically, a tomato is a fruit." Yeah yeah. We get it. Very cute.
